# Some statistics calculated:

## Linear Regression
#? dropped-NaN DF #
# with outliers: 0.30 
# without outliers: 0.63 +- 0.03

#? filled-NaN DF #
# with outliers: 0.26
# without outliers: (+- 0.03)
#* ffill, bfill, mean, median, mode
#  0.58,  0.58,  0.55, 0.56,   0.62

## Decision Tree
# with outliers: -0.031
# without outliers: 0.32

## tried using DBSCAN to remove outliers instead othersf IQR,
 change was about 0.014 worse

## tired to remove outliers before managing NA values,
 results were slightly different, LR went down, others went up!

## After one hot encoding, everything have changed!
 I am getting too much over fit in each: linear regression, kNN Regression, and decision tree
 but not in Random forest.
